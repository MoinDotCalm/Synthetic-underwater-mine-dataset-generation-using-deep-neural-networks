# Synthetic-underwater-mine-dataset-generation-using-deep-neural-networks

This paper presents the implementation details and performance evaluation of RVUMR-14, a custom dataset specifically designed for underwater mine classification. Due to limited availability of images, various augmentation techniques were employed to increase the dataset size. The dataset consists of fourteen different types of underwater mines, with 150 images in each class. Further, annotated to get masks with labels for any future semantic segemtation applications. The The Adam optimizer was employed during training, while the Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalisation (CLAHE) technique was used for preprocessing. The dataset was used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, with training and validation split 80:20. The model had a 91% accuracy rate. RVUMR-14's efficacy is verified by a comparison that was made with the benchmarked CIFAR-10 dataset, where RVUMR-14 outperformed CIFAR-10, obtaining an accuracy of 91% compared to 76%."
